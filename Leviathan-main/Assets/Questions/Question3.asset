  question: Greeting you majesty, highest of us all, child of only the sun itself.
    I, your humbled servant, need your advice regarding the tragic events happening
    in your kingdom. A dry summer has led to a poor harvest. If that wasn't enough,
    a disease is spreading  punishing the already suffering population. As always,
    those who already are at the bottom of our social ladder suffer the most from
    such tragic events. I, your most loyal servant, friend of the lowest, mister
    whiskas, understand this. But also, to ensure the strength of the kingdom during
    these dark times, supplying those who control the economic well-being is crucial
    to the future of our great nation. But there are only limited supplies left.
  answer1: We shall help those who suffer...
  answer2: Ensure the kingdoms well-being...
  consequence_1: The state is only as strong as its weakest link. There's no benefit
    of an running economy when the people are suffering. Mister Whiskas nodded after
    my decision to not implement privileges for the upper class, but he obviously
    he disappointed.
  consequence_2: Being a king is not a easy thing. Often you are confronted with
    decisions that will lead to people suffering. The peasants where disappointing
    that their starving cries couldn't be answered. But with keeping the economy
    running, the kingdom still has a future and a chance of overcoming this crisis.
