  question: Greetings my lord. The disease is almost over thanks to your guidance.
    But there is still a ongoing hunger crisis. Yesterday, some peasants where caught
    looting a charitable foundation run by the upper class. The peasants claim that
    the money does in fact not go to the urchins but is used by the upper class as
    a way to evade taxes. On the other hand, the upper class is furious that the
    people they wanted to help are now stealing from them. Clearly one side is lying.
  answer1: The collected taxes are suspiciously low...
  answer2: Give them one finger and they take the whole hand...
  consequence_1: Those bastards... As the urchins are already not suffering enough,
    now even the little whats left for them got stolen by those who pledged to help
    them. But now there is justice. The foundation is under the control of the crown,
    to ensure the money gets where its needed. But something is suspicious... Wasn't
    Mister Whiskas part of the foundation?
  consequence_2: After the criminal scum was caught stealing from those who tried
    to help them, I needed to make an example of what justice is. The tried to bit
    the hand who was feeding them, so chopped their hands of.
