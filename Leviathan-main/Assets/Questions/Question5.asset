  question: Greetings our highness. The court needs your judgement in a case of unknown
    cruelty. Cannibalism, my lord. The monster is claiming that the was an verbal
    agreement between him and his victim, that for one to survive, the other would
    sacrifice his body and live. I think he's clearly lying but the ongoing starvation
    wave let's people make horrible decisions.
  answer1: Throw him into the prison...
  answer2: Off with his head...
  consequence_1: Whats right and whats wrong? Can a man be sentenced to death only
    based on the fact that there is no proof of his words? I don't think that is
    right. The man literally gave his body to help another one survive. If the survivor
    would have been executed, the sacrifice would have been pointless.
  consequence_2: Dark times bring out  the animal, the beast, that sleeps in all
    of us. It lets men and women do horrible things... Even if its understandable
    that he just wanted to survive, there is no justification for this monstrosity
    in our world. Even if it means suffering even more, we can't allow a violation
    of our humanity or anarchy will be to only sign left...
