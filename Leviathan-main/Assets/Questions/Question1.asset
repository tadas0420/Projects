  question: Oh majesty, what a wonderful day it is today as it is the tenth anniversary
    of your great reign. What a present it is, send from god himself, for all of
    us be lead and guarded by you, the most royal royalty of them all. To celebrate,
    we arranged a great feast. Unfortunately, there is only enough wheat to bake
    cake to feed the upper class. But instead, we could bake cookies. They will not
    fill the stomach, but every citizen will be able to get at least one.
  answer1: Cake for upper class...
  answer2: Cookies for everybody...
  consequence_1: I made the wise decision to used the wheat the most efficient way.
    The upper class was pleased. Despite being left out, the lower classes still
    took part in the parade.
  consequence_2: The kingdom is all of us. So I decided to let everybody be part
    of the feast, providing cookies for all my wonderful people. At the end of the
    parade, a women with a small toddler on her arm even presented me some beautiful
    flowers.
