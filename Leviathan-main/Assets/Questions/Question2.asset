    motivation of completing the household work and complaining that she has to do
    it all by herself. Could you please recall her what her duties are?

  consequence_1: A woman has to fulfill their natural role, same for man as well.
    But are does really natural roles, or have they just been shaped by our society
    itself, for so long dominated by male leaders?

    your gut feeling. Even if it means the majority will not support you. This is
    the only way, society can change and grow. There will be no place for inequality
    under my reign.
